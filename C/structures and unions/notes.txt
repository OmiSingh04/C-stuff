Structures are like classes
These are entities which store multiple data

like
Struct would be a Student
and data in it would be 
Name
roll no
adm no
etc


quite simple
very similar to classes
very useful in implementing a data structure

so like,
struct Student{
	
	char name[20];
	int roll;
	int adm_no;
};

Structure padding:

ok this is something interesting. has a lot to do with the architecture of the
pc/compiler
