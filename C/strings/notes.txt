Array of characters
{'j','a','v','a', '\0'} == "java"
compiler appends \0 at the end.

C strings are terminated by the null character.

whenever there is a \0, it marks the end of the string

to traverse through the char array, we use the \0 to identify the end of the
string


gets() and puts()

declares in the header file stdio.h

they are used for input and output operations on strings

gets() -> used to read characters until new line
idk if it is deprecated
people said avoid using this as much as possible :)
