The purpose of this concept is to be able to allocate memory at RUNTIME

malloc()
calloc()
realloc()
free()

these are use to allocate and de-accocate memory in the heap(which is where
the dynamic memory is stored, and proceed opposite to a stack)


in constrast, the static memory allocation is like, static, doesnt change at
runtime :)

arrays are static, static memory allocation is used in making arrays

lists are dynamic by their property, hence dynamic memory allocation is used
in making lists
like linked list

FUNCTION DESCRIPTION:
malloc(): allocates single block of memory
calloc(): allocates multiple block of memory
realloc(): reallocates the memory occupies by malloc() or calloc()

free(): free the dynamically allocated memory
